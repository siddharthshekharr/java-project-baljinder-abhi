I am cloning the git repository from the GitHub account to the VS code. I am currently using git to keep track of changes that are previously modified. To do that, we need to use git commands in order to keep track of modified changes to the ability of git. In order to put into one version once that's modified, use git checkout for the project you previously made changes. And if we are to revert these changes back to the original version of your project, using git switch -. Using git push to synchronise the commits from the local git to the local GitHub. Isn't that easy folks? How would you like to upload your project if you were to present it to the collaborators who can work with you as your teammates? What can you possibly do as a particular experts? Using git push?
